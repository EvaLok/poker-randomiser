## notes
- based on `Math.rand` - nothing revolutionary happening there
- currently only Windows build because that's what most poker clients are on (it's open source, you can always build for linux or mac yourself if you like)
- currently 130mb for a very simple app.. dev time is expensive and memory is cheap, what can i say, also, electron (and my first time writing an electron app)
- may add more configurability in the future depending on my needs
